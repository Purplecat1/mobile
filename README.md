# GreenThreads Mobile App

Prototype app for GreenThreads co. built with Flutter

## About This Project

GreenThreads in a nutshell is an untraditional online thrifting store, but what makes them unique is their assurance to high quality, environmentally and cost friendly clothing. Each piece of clothing that makes it through to their online platforms is scrutinized by the GreenThreads team for quality assurance, assigned a fair price for both buyer and seller, and shipped to the buyer at a budget friendly cost. In addition, the GreenThreads business model appeals to wary online shoppers by displaying sizes in terms of tailored measurements, like waist, bust, and chest, rather than arbitrarily company assigned sizing so that buyers can be assured of the fit. And lastly, GreenThreads makes it even easier for new shoppers by grouping items in terms of fashion aesthetic so that itâ€™s even easier to contextualize pieces that buyers would like to wear.

## How it Works

Once the user opens up the app they are welcomed with a login page featuring an email field and password field. The user can chose to sign up or login with their credentials. Once they're logged in, they recieve a welcome page. This page gives a brief description on navigating through the app and what GreenThreads goal is. After they close the welcome page, they are able to shop by aesthetic(90s, soft, egirl, etc.). If the user clicks on one of these aesthetics they can view the products that are associated with the aesthetic. If they want to learn more about the aesthetic they can click the Read More button in the top right hand side of the screen. If the user wants to view all products on the app they can click the shopping button on the bottom of the screen. On the shopping page they can filter items by type, sort prices and view specific details about the product by clicking on it. If the user wants to sell an item, they can go to the selling page by clicking the sell icon on the bottom of the screen. This page allows the user to input their name, email, title of product, description of product, measurements, and take or upload a picture. Once they fill out the form and submit, it is sent to the GreenThreads team for verification.
